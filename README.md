Wallet API Project - README.md
PROJECT OVERVIEW

Wallet API is a Spring Boot application that simulates wallet operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry. The system is designed to handle high concurrency (1000 RPS per wallet) safely using pessimistic locking, and ensures robust error handling.

Stack & Technologies Used:

Java 17, Spring Boot 3

PostgreSQL (database)

Liquibase (database migrations)

Docker & Docker Compose (containerization)

JUnit 5 (unit & integration tests)

Postman (API testing)

The project is production-ready and adheres to best practices in REST API design, exception handling, and transaction management.
